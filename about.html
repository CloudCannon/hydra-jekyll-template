				<p>Solidity is a statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine.</p>
				<p>Smart contracts are programs that are executed inside a peer-to-peer network where nobody has special authority over the execution, and thus they allow to implement tokens of value, ownership, voting and other kinds of logics. Note that when deploying contracts, you should use the latest released version of Solidity. This is because breaking changes as well as new features and bug fixes are introduced regularly.</p>
				<p>Currently, 0.x version numbers are being used to indicate the fast pace of change.</p>
				<p>Solidity was publicly previewed for the first time in November 2014 at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIqGDNPO5YM&feature=emb_title">Devcon0</a>. Solidity v0.1.0 turned 5 years old on July 8th 2020. You can read more about Solidity's history <a href="https://solidity.ethereum.org/2020/07/08/solidity-turns-5/">here</a>.</p>
				<p>The Solidity programming language is an open-source, community project
					governed by a core team. The core team is sponsored by the <a href="https://ethereum.foundation/">Ethereum Foundation</a>.</p>
