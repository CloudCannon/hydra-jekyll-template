            <h3 class="faq-subheading editable"> PowerUp </h3>
            <!--QUESTION-->
            <a class="_accordion slab editable">
                Why should I come to PowerUp?
            </a>
            <!--ANSWER-->
            <div class="panel editable">
                <p>
                    For too long, self-serving corporations and right-wing power brokers have captured our democracy, making inequality worse and ravaging our environment. We need to build a new form of power that breaks this hold.
<br><br>
Securing a safe world for future generations is going to come down to us — and we’re going to have to step up now. At PowerUp, you will converge with a thousand passionate GetUp members for a weekend of shared values, practical skills workshops and strategy sessions. Then together we’ll launch a new national network of Action Groups that can take back power for everyday people. 
<br><br>
If you want to get the skills, tools and connections to make a difference and you’re ready to take action, then we need you at PowerUp. <a class="blue" href="/ticket/">Buy your ticket now.</a>

            <a class="_accordion slab editable">
                What can I expect at PowerUp?

            <!--ANSWER-->
            <div class="panel editable">
                <p>
                    The PowerUp program has been built to maximise your opportunity to interact, connect and learn in engaging spaces. You can expect to spend about 80% of your time in small practical skills workshops, and 20% in all-in plenary spaces led by inspiring keynote speakers. There’s also plenty of breaks to stretch your legs, grab a coffee and get to know your fellow attendees outside of the formal program. Stay tuned for the full program in June.

             <!--QUESTION-->
            <a class="_accordion slab editable">
                What will I learn at PowerUp?
            </a>
            <!--ANSWER-->
            <div class="panel editable">
                <p>
                    Your PowerUp experience will focus on practical skills building, campaign strategy and community organising fundamentals.
<br><br>
During workshops, you’ll learn about taking on leadership roles in your community, how to build and sustain effective groups, and other critical organising skills. At all-in plenaries, you’ll learn about GetUp’s strategy to scale up people-power in Australia, and how you can play a key role in it. 
<br><br>
Perhaps most importantly, you’ll build meaningful connections with other attendees from your home electorate that could form the basis for a local Action Group.

                I’m passionate about attending PowerUp but can’t afford it. Does PowerUp offer any financial assistance?

                <p>
                   As a Sydney-based conference, we recognise that the cost of a ticket, accommodation and travel can be especially prohibitive for interstate folk. We also acknowledge that the rising cost of living has put a strain on many households.

                      We understand it’s a really big ask for members to attend a weekend-long training conference in Sydney. For a lot of you, it’s a big distance to travel, a decent cost and two days away from home. We’re really excited about PowerUp and want to encourage and support GetUp members to join us. If there is anything you are unsure of, or want to discuss further please contact the PowerUp team at <a href="mailto:powerup@getup.org.au" class="blue">powerup@getup.org.au</a> and we’d be happy to help.

                    PowerUp aims to keep ticket prices as low as possible by not including lunch in the ticket price. Instead a variety of food vendors will be open on-site. Accommodation and travel is also not included in the ticket price.

               Why are there limited tickets available in each electorate?

            <!--ANSWER-->
            <div class="panel editable">
                <p>
                    PowerUp has capped the number of tickets available for each electorate to ensure there’s an even spread of attendees. This will allow PowerUp to organise ticket-holders into evenly-sized workshop groups based upon their federal electorate. If you want to buy a ticket but they’ve sold out in your electorate, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeS_ke0eFqMP3UTtLRa12PSiW5X6SOuJWAX3yXRh7sk6m50Yg/viewform?c=0&w=1" class="blue" target="_blank">click here to go on the waiting list.</a>

            <div class="panel editable">
                <p>
                    PowerUp is a limited ticket training event, and GetUp has designed the programme with about forty key electorates in mind. If your electorate isn’t listed in the drop-down menu when you go to purchase a ticket, you can opt to purchase an ‘Other’ ticket, or email <a href="mailto:powerup@getup.org.au" class="blue">powerup@getup.org.au</a> for more information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Please keep in mind that the vast majority of attendees will come from the electorates listed and you may be slotted into another electorate’s workshop group.

            <div class="panel editable">
                <p>
                   Yes! It’s really important that each attendee has had their details recorded against a ticket. That’s because each ticket holder will be sent a registration pack in the post and will be allocated to a program pathway based upon their location. So, if you’ve entered the same details against multiple tickets, please <a href="mailto:powerup@getup.org.au" class="blue">email powerup@getup.org.au</a> to update.

                <p>
                  Unfortunately it is not possible to purchase a ticket on the day. That’s because a lot of planning goes into assigning PowerUp attendees into workshop groups and creating personalised registration packs before the event. PowerUp is expected to be a sell-out event so if you’re keen, <a href="http://www.powerup.org.au/ticket" class="blue">buy your ticket now!</a>

            <!--ANSWER-->
            <div class="panel editable">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0">
                    It’s a good idea to search online for the cheapest flight. There are many sites that compare the price of flights across all airlines, two of which are:

                 <p>
                 Accommodation rates will rise the closer we get to September. So, if you’re tossing up whether you can attend, or waiting to find out if you can find free accommodation, one idea is to book a reasonably priced room now that has a flexible, risk-free cancellation policy. It's possible to find rooms you can cancel within a few days of the booked date on sites such as: <a href="http://booking.com.au" class="blue" target="_blank">Booking.com</a>, <a href="http://airbnb.com" class="blue" target="_blank">Airbnb</a> and <a href="http://wotif.com.au" class="blue" target="_blank">Wotif</a>.

                <p style="margin-bottom: 0">
                    If you’re only in town for PowerUp then it might suit you to book accommodation as close to UNSW as possible. Central Sydney is only a 5 km bus ride from UNSW and offers a wide range of affordable accommodation options.

               ABLE TO OFFER A SPARE ROOM IN SYDNEY?
            </a>
            <!--ANSWER-->
            <div class="panel ">
                <p>
                    Do you have a spare room in Sydney you’d be happy to offer an interstate PowerUp attendee?
                    <br><br>
                    It's incredibly expensive for interstate members to attend. There's flights, accommodation, and all the other costs involved in being away from home. Understandably, many people would like to attend but are struggling with the finances. 
                    <br><br>
                    To help make PowerUp more affordable, GetUp has developed a simple <a href="http://rooms.powerup.org.au/available_rooms?t=NOT_AVAILABLE&utm_content=18631&utm_campaign=Have_a_spare_room_in_Sydney_for_PowerUp_&utm_source=blast&utm_medium=email" class="blue" target="_blank">Spare Rooms Directory.</a> 
                    <br><br>
                    This directory allows Sydney GetUp members to list their spare room online and interstate attendees can request to stay. You make arrangements that work for you, and then host them on the 23-24 September weekend. It's as simple as that! 
                    <br><br>

                    </a>
                    <br><br>
                    The more Sydneysiders who can offer a spare room, the more interstate members who can afford to travel to PowerUp. Many interstate members are hinging their decision to attend on a spare room offer, so if you do have a spare room to offer please list it as soon as you're able. 
                    <br><br>

                <p>
                    Are you travelling interstate and looking for a free room in Sydney to keep down costs? PowerUp has built a simple site that will connect folks looking for a spare room with Sydney GetUp members offering spare rooms. 
                    <br><br>
                    <a href="http://rooms.powerup.org.au/available_rooms" class="blue" target="_blank">View our spare rooms directory here and get in touch with some generous hosts!</a>
                    <br><br>
                    We hope you find a spare room, but unfortunately there are no guarantees. Please make a contingency plan as soon as possible to avoid disappointment. 
                    <br><br>
                    Accommodation rates will rise the closer we get to September, so one idea is to book a reasonably priced room now that has a flexible, risk-free cancellation policy. It's possible to find rooms you can cancel within a few days of the booked date on sites such as: <a href="http://booking.com.au" class="blue" target="_blank">Booking.com</a>, <a href="http://airbnb.com" class="blue" target="_blank">Airbnb</a> and <a href="http://wotif.com.au" class="blue" target="_blank">Wotif</a>.

                   PowerUp aims to keep ticket prices as low as possible by not including lunch in the ticket price. Instead, a variety of food vendors --- with gluten free and vegetarian options ---  will be open on-site at UNSW across the weekend. We’ll update you with more info about this soon. There will also be complimentary fruit and biscuits to keep energy up!

                   Yes! It’s recommended that you bring along your water bottle and fill it up throughout the day. There are quite a few water bubblers around the campus, and you can also fill up your water bottle in the bathrooms. If you need to, it’s also possible to purchase water on the day in the nearby food court.
