                What does my ticket include?

                    Your ticket covers you for the entire two-day conference, plus tea and coffee in the morning and afternoon breaks, and light snacks. Your ticket also serves as a ticket to the PowerUp after-party on Saturday evening.

                What doesn’t my ticket include?

                <p>
                    To keep the cost of tickets down, lunch is not included. Instead we’ve organised for the nearby UNSW foodcourt to remain open so you have a great choice of lunch on both days.

            <!--QUESTION-->
            <a class="_accordion slab">
                I’m passionate about attending PowerUp but can’t afford the cost. Does PowerUp offer any financial assistance?
            </a>
            <!--ANSWER-->
            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                    As a Sydney-based conference, we recognise that the cost of a ticket, accommodation and travel can be especially prohibitive for interstate folk. We also acknowledge that the rising cost of living has put a strain on many households.
                    <br> <br>
                    That’s why PowerUp has put aside a limited scholarship fund. If you're passionate about attending PowerUp but need some help, <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/Or6VjKm6xFlUdIUn1">please fill out this confidential application form. </a>

            <!--QUESTION-->
            <a class="_accordion slab">
                I’d like to donate some money towards the PowerUp scholarship fund. Can I do this?
            </a>
            <!--ANSWER-->
            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                    You definitely can, thank you! <a href="#">Just click here to donate. </a> Even just a few dollars will help cover the cost of another attendee’s ticket, travel, accommodation and food. Alternatively, if you haven’t purchased your ticket yet you can opt for a philanthropy ticket, which helps out in the same way.

                <p>
                    There are no train services to UNSW, but the venue is serviced by many bus routes. The easiest way to plan your trip is to use Transport NSW Trip Planner: <a href="https://transportnsw.info/trip#/">transportnsw.info/trip/ </a>

            <a class="_accordion slab">
                I’m not from Sydney. Where should I book accommodation?
            </a>
            <!--ANSWER-->
            <div class="panel ">
                <p>
                    If you’re only in town for PowerUp then it might suit you to book accommodation as close to UNSW as possible. Central Sydney is only 5km bus ride from UNSW and offers a wide range of affordable accommodation options. Alternatively, Coogee Beach is just 3km down the road and has a range of options too.

                    To get a full sense of the options out there, you could you check hotel booking site <a href="https://www.booking.com.au">www.booking.com.au</a> and <a href="https://www.airbnb.com.au/"> www.airbnb.com.au. </a>

            <div class="panel ">
                <p>
                    Your ticket should be automatically sent to the email address you provided when you purchased your ticket. If you can’t see it in your inbox, please check your junk or spam folder. If it’s not there, please email tickets@powerup.org.au to have the ticket resent.

                Does the ticket need to match the name and details of the holder?

            <!--ANSWER-->
            <div class="panel ">
                <p>
                    It’s really important that each attendee has had their details recorded against a ticket. That’s because each ticket holder will be sent a registration pack in the post and will be allocated to a program pathway based upon their location. So, if you’ve entered the same details against multiple tickets, please email powerup@getup.org.au to update.
                </p>

            <div class="panel ">
                <p>
                    No problem, just email powerup@getup.org.au to update the name and details attached to that ticket so we can send the new ticket holder a registration pack in the post and allocate them to a program pathway based upon their location.

                <p>
                    PowerUp is expected to be a sell-out event so don’t miss out. Unfortunately it won’t be possible to purchase your tickets on the day.
