            <!--QUESTION-->
            <a class="_accordion slab">
                Why should I come to PowerUp?
            </a>
            <!--ANSWER-->
            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                    For too long, self-serving corporations and right-wing power brokers have captured our democracy, making inequality worse and ravaging our environment. We need to build a new form of power that breaks this hold.

Securing a safe world for future generations is going to come down to us — and we’re going to have to step up now. At PowerUp, you will converge with a thousand passionate GetUp members for a weekend of shared values, practical skills workshops and strategy sessions. Then together we’ll launch a new national network of Action Groups that can take back power for everyday people. 

If you want to get the skills, tools and connections to make a difference and you’re ready to take action, then we need you at PowerUp. <a class="blue" href="/ticket/">Buy your ticket now.</a>

            <a class="_accordion slab">
                What can I expect at PowerUp?
            </a>
            <!--ANSWER-->
            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                    The PowerUp program has been built to maximise your opportunity to interact, connect and learn in engaging spaces. You can expect to spend about 80% of your time in small practical skills workshops, and 20% in all-in plenary spaces led by inspiring keynote speakers. There’s also plenty of breaks to stretch your legs, grab a coffee and get to know your fellow attendees outside of the formal program. Stay tuned for the full program in June.

             <!--QUESTION-->
            <a class="_accordion slab">
                What will I learn at PowerUp?
            </a>
            <!--ANSWER-->
            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                    Your PowerUp experience will focus on practical skills building, campaign strategy and community organising fundamentals.

During workshops, you’ll learn about taking on leadership roles in your community, how to build and sustain effective groups, and other critical organising skills. At all-in plenaries, you’ll learn about GetUp’s strategy to scale up people-power in Australia, and how you can play a key role in it. 

Perhaps most importantly, you’ll build meaningful connections with other attendees from your home electorate that could form the basis for a local Action Group.

                I’m passionate about attending PowerUp but can’t afford it. Does PowerUp offer any financial assistance?

            <!--ANSWER-->
            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                   As a Sydney-based conference, we recognise that the cost of a ticket, accommodation and travel can be especially prohibitive for interstate folk. We also acknowledge that the rising cost of living has put a strain on many households.

PowerUp has put aside a limited scholarship fund. If you're passionate about attending PowerUp but need some help, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe0YquhF6-YVtQoEQYt5XIyMjHkVWQNq4nRXQ9D6IEVKGPEtQ/viewform?c=0&w=1" class="blue">please fill out this confidential application form.</a>

                <p>
                    PowerUp aims to keep ticket prices as low as possible by not including lunch in the ticket price. Instead a variety of food vendors will be open on-site. Accommodation and travel is also not included in the ticket price.

               Why are there limited tickets available in each electorate?

            <!--ANSWER-->
            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                    PowerUp has capped the number of tickets available for each electorate to ensure there’s an even spread of attendees. This will allow PowerUp to organise ticket-holders into evenly-sized workshop groups based upon their federal electorate. If you want to buy a ticket but they’ve sold out in your electorate, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeS_ke0eFqMP3UTtLRa12PSiW5X6SOuJWAX3yXRh7sk6m50Yg/viewform?c=0&w=1" class="blue">click here to go on the waiting list.</a>

                    Your ticket is automatically sent to the email address you provide when you purchase your ticket. If you can’t see it in your inbox, please check your junk or spam folder. If it’s not there, please <a href="mailto:powerup@getup.org.au" class="blue">email powerup@getup.org.au</a> to have the ticket resent.

                Does the ticket need to match the name and details of the holder?

            <!--ANSWER-->
            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                   Yes! It’s really important that each attendee has had their details recorded against a ticket. That’s because each ticket holder will be sent a registration pack in the post and will be allocated to a program pathway based upon their location. So, if you’ve entered the same details against multiple tickets, please <a href="mailto:powerup@getup.org.au" class="blue">email powerup@getup.org.au</a> to update.

                  Sure thing. Just <a href="mailto:powerup@getup.org.au" class="blue">email powerup@getup.org.au</a> to organise for the cost of your ticket to be refunded.

            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                  Unfortunately it is not possible to purchase a ticket on the day. That’s because a lot of planning goes into posting you a registration pack before the event and organising you into a workshop group. PowerUp is expected to be a sell-out event so if you’re keen, <a href="http://www.powerup.org.au/ticket" class="blue">buy your ticket now!</a>

                    If you can, book your flights and accommodation as soon as possible. Footy finals will be on in Sydney on the 23-24 September weekend, so prices will likely go up the closer it gets to the date.

                <p>
                    If you’re only in town for PowerUp then it might suit you to book accommodation as close to UNSW as possible. Central Sydney is only a 5 km bus ride from UNSW and offers a wide range of affordable accommodation options. Alternatively, Coogee Beach is just 3km down the road and has a range of options too.

               WANTED / OFFERED: Free spare room in Sydney
            </a>
            <!--ANSWER-->
            <div class="panel ">
                <p>
                   Do you have a spare room in Sydney you’d be happy to offer an interstate PowerUp attendee? Alternatively, are you travelling interstate and looking for a free room in Sydney to keep down costs?

PowerUp is building a simple site that will connect spare rooms in Sydney with attendees looking for one. 

If you’ve got a room to offer, all you’ll have to do is list the suburb, occupancy of the room and your contact details. Then all you have to do is wait for an introductory email from a fellow PowerUp attendee. It’s then up to you to offer them the room, and pass on more details.
