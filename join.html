				<h1 align="left">We are recruiting!</h1>
				<p align="justify">We are looking for postdocs, students, scientists, and programmers excited about modeling and computational challenges in gene therapy, genomics, single-cell analysis, and genome editing technology.</p>
<p align="justify">The ideal candidate(s) should have received (or expect to receive soon) a Ph.D. in Statistics, Bioinformatics, Computer Science, Computational Biology, Mathematics, Physics, or related fields. Prior experience with applications in the bio* field is good to have but optional.<br>
</p>
<p align="justify">From a methodological perspective, we are interested in stochastic processes over graph, analysis of spatio-temporal processes, (non-)linear modeling using differential equations, and agent-based modeling.</p>
<p align="justify">From a biological perspective, we work on gene therapy preclinical and clinical studies, hematopoietic stem cell biology, immune cells in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, and genome editing technology.</p>
<p align="justify">We are happy to host visiting Master's students or Ph.D. students interested in spending some time in the lab (at least 6 months) working on collaborative projects that intersect the lab research topics.</p>
<p align="justify">Our lab is committed to diversity and equality.</p>
<p align="justify">If interested, please send your CV and a brief description of your goals, current and future research interests to Danilo: <a href="mailto:danilo.pellin@childrens.harvard.edu">danilo.pellin@childrens.harvard.edu</a>
