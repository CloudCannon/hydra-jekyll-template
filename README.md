# Solidity Language Portal

The Solidity Language Portal is based on the [Hydra template](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/templates/hydra/) for Jekyll.

## Develop

Hydra was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) version 3.3.1, but should support newer versions as well.

Install the dependencies with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

~~~bash
$ bundle install
~~~

Run `jekyll` commands through Bundler to ensure you're using the right versions:

~~~bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
~~~
