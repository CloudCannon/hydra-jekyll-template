Put your layouts in `_layouts`, your includes in `_includes`, your sass files in `_sass` and any other assets in `assets`.

To experiment with this code, add some sample content and run `bundle exec jekyll serve` â€“ this directory is setup just like a Jekyll site!

## Installation

Include the gem in your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'jekyll-theme-hydra'
```

Hydra's default layout depends on the `jekyll-seo-tag` gem. Add in the relevant section. Example:

```ruby
group :jekyll_plugins do
  # ...
  gem 'jekyll-seo-tag', '2.6.1'
  # ...
end
```


And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: jekyll-theme-hydra
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jekyll-theme-hydra


## Basic setup

1. Add your site and author details in `_config.yml`.
2. Add your Google Analytics and Disqus keys to `_config.yml`.
3. Get a workflow going to see your site's output (with [CloudCannon](https://app.cloudcannon.com/) or Jekyll locally).


## Usage / Editing

Hydra is already optimised for adding, updating and removing pages, staff, advice, company details and footer elements in CloudCannon.

### Posts

* Add, update or remove a post in the *Posts* collection.
* The **Staff Author** field links to members in the **Staff** collection.
* Documentation pages are organised in the navigation by category, with URLs based on the path inside the `_docs` folder.
* Change the defaults when new posts are created in `_posts/_defaults.md`.

### Contact Form

* Preconfigured to work with CloudCannon, but easily changed to another provider (e.g. [FormSpree](https://formspree.io/)).
* Sends email to the address listed in company details.

### Staff

* Reused around the site to save multiple editing locations.
* Add `excluded_in_search: true` to any documentation page's front matter to exclude that page in the search results.

### Navigation

* Exposed as a data file to give clients better access.
* Set in the *Data* / *Navigation* section.

### Footer

* Exposed as a data file to give clients better access.
* Set in the *Data* / *Footer* section.

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/[USERNAME]/hello. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.

## Development

Hydra was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) version 3.3.1, but should support newer versions as well.

Install the dependencies with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

~~~bash
$ bundle install
~~~

Run `jekyll` commands through Bundler to ensure you're using the right versions:

~~~bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
~~~

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled.
To add a custom directory to your theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `jekyll-theme-hydra.gemspec` accordingly.
